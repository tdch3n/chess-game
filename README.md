A link containing a Google Drive folder with relevant files due to upload limits.

This project contains 2 models which are used to predict the likelihood of Tyler1 making each possible chess move in a given board state. This will then decide out of the top X stockfish moves (increase X for lower difficulty) which of those moves returns the highest probability of being played and the bot will play that move.

Please ensure that the folder remains in the same layout as it is on Google Drive so the notebooks work as intended.

Due to upload limits on GitHub the notebooks and pickles containing the models can be found here:
